Did you map the area yourself in something like iD Editor by hand based on the satellite  images or did you upload it from cordinates in an official file by ""importing"" the file or something like that? "," Most of the trails were already there. But some had some errors and none were labeled.

" Hey, thanks for contributing. I think the service roads that you added near Oakland Beach Elementary School should not be tagged as ""access=private"", since they are accessible by the general public. I have changed the tags to ""access=permissive"" in changeset https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/83890036             ---              Published using OSMCha: https://osmcha.org/changesets/82415421  "," Hi, Thanks for your response. I've added the access tag as private considering that these roads are built and maintained by the school. If we give the access tag as permissive, I'm assuming it would be a safety issue for students. To better understand this, could you help me with the general traffic flows through these roads? Regards, sreejam"," Yeah, now that I think about it, ""access=permissive"" probably isn't the best tag. My reasoning is based on the fact that Oakland Beach is a public/state school, so public access is expected as events may be held there. Also, the service roads provide access/parking space for the playground and fields during non-school periods. I guess a better way to tag this might be ""access=destination"" or more narrowly as ""access=customers""? But I think that ""access=private"" is too restrictive given that it is a public space, so there is no individual permissions that a person needs in order to use these roads. It's more of a situation where you implicitly have access to the school area unless you are explicitly banned for disruption &c, which I feel is the case for most public schools in Rhode Island. What do you think? Thanks, azsr"," Hi, Thanks for the detailed explanation. While I agree with you on ""destination"" tag fitting best in the scenario but I see that doesn't really justify the edit as per the OSM Wiki information. As the situation is ambiguous here, should we look at adding the ""unknown"" tag as access?

" Hi, I agree that a relation is the right way to do this, but the tagging may need to be updated a bit. I believe current practice is that the relation should be ""type=boundary"" rather than multipolygon, and instead of protected_area=nature, the tag ""protect_class=5"" would be more appropriate. The leisure=nature_reserve and landuse=recreation_ground are possibly redundant, but I've been including them on a lot of similar open spaces in CO to make sure they get scooped up by the data consumers, though in the future I think the protect_class tag is more precise.             ---              Published using OSMCha: https://osmcha.org/changesets/83787470  "," Hmm... Kind of a tough call.  With it marked type=boundary instead of multipolygon it no longer seems to recognize it as two areas and just as a boundary.  I'm not sure what these should be considered as - like a city boundary or a polygon like landuse?  Indeed it seems having both leisure= and landuse=recreation does seem redundant, but it is possible for protected area to have leisure prohibited, and that numerical denotation https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:boundary%3Dprotected_area seems really confusing, ugh.  Feel free to change it, I was hoping to change as little as possible from the previous configuration hence the original tagging remained."," The numerical designations are indeed confusing... As for the relation type, ""multipolygon"" was deprecated a while back for boundaries, it is best to use type=boundary. It is OK that iD doesn't call this an ""area"", the rest of the system knows what a boundary is. As for the other tags, I believe ""protected_area=nature"" to just be a mistake, that isn't a documented tag with any consistent use, I think ""protect_class=5"" or maybe 6 is most appropriate, alongside recreation_ground and/or nature reserve, depending on the use of the land. Check out South Table Mountain Park's relation, which I updated a while back while making open space areas in Boulder/Denver/Jeffco more consistently tagged: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/7088454"," Okay, made some changes in changeset #83831641 - Kind of tough to categorize this natural area - as far as I know there's nothing special about this land other than a creek goes through it.  Pretty much just leaving it open and letting people walk through it on the designated paths (i.e. no camping, etc.) but mainly letting it be a gap to prevent more urban sprawl / development. This is a bit different than Long View Farm Open Space to the south.  This is yet a different category, and it too needs to be worked on..."," Thanks, that looks good for now. I do think there is some work to be done in classifying Open Space, as we do it in Colorado - it defies a lot of normal tagging because it is protected, but also not really ""for"" anything - it is just space that is intentionally kept open, but with somewhat vague uses. In Boulder, it can be a nature reserve, but it can also be leased out to farmers. In any event, this way you are at least tagged consistently with the others in the state, and when some better plan comes together for tagging open space, it will be easy to find and update."

 Your landuse=grass should be landuse=meadow. https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:landuse%3Dmeadow, I’ve looked at the satellite images closely and they seem to look like grass. I’m not sure if the field I’ve tagged is a meadow., I looked at the grass description and the one I’ve tagged has a mow pattern in the satellite image. ," Meadows are grassy pastures or fields used for things like feeding livestock. The landuse grass tag is more for lawns or yards. It is often used for areas which serve to other purpose but to be a grassy area. A few examples would be median between a divided highway, the middle of a roundabout, the area inside a airport. You can see the nearby Chase Field as a good example of landuse=grass. As an airport the grassy areas there serve only as ground cover and not to feed livestock. I don't have an iPhone so I don't know how Go Maps!! is displaying the different presets to you but you can try looking for pastures and that should be the correct tagging preset.

" Howdy, welcome to openstreetmap and thank you for your interest in contributing. I see that recently you’ve edited interstate highways in Colorado and given them names such as, the “Dwight D. Eisenhower Highway” and the, “CanAm Highway”. It’s important not to conflate honorary or commemorative designations of routes such as the Pan-American, CanAm, Eisenhower, etc., with the actual name of single roads within the route system of which they are members. The name of a route doesn't necessarily, and often is completely unrelated, to the names of the ways that make up its members.  There is no signage on Colorado interstates giving highways these names. Coloradans simply refer to these interstates as, “I-70”, “I-25”, etcetera. The “name” tag should be left blank as per the wiki. Besides, just so you know, the official name of the Eisenhower route was changed in 1990 by the U.S. Congress to the, ""Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways.""  Will you please go back and remove all of the name tags you added in all of the affected changesets?

The wikidata source you added here reflects this as does the National Register of Historic Places. Thanks :) https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/74000571 "," Different train operators often have different names for the same station. Amtrak refers to the same station as just ""Denver, Colorado"" with ""Union Station"" as a subtitle, as is common with other major central stations around the country: https://www.amtrak.com/stations/den.html Also, the Wikipedia article has it named this way: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Union_Station Of course, most other union stations are officially called just ""Union Station"" as well. But they're typically tagged with name=""[city] Union Station"" to avoid adding ambiguity in the national network. A train route may pass through multiple union stations, so it'd be frustrating to work on keeping the route relations sorted without having names be nationally unique. To this end, I typically tag the building itself as close to the official name as possible. So in this case I'd have the historic train hall be named ""Union Station"". Sometimes I might even add the building's name to the label node (i.e. railway=station) under alt_name to help people find it with Nominatim, like Icicle Station in Leavenworth, WA: https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6997575339 But the label node could just as well just be named ""Denver""! Of course, there are other railway stations in Denver, so that doesn't help data consumers disambiguate. If you choose to change the name back, please make sure people can still search for it by keeping ""Denver Union Station"" in another tag, such as alt_name or nat_name. Best, Clay", No problem. I'll change the name back to Union Station and add alt_name=Denver Union Station. Cheers.

There's a cycle lane visible on aerial imagery and the bridge tagged as cycleway=lane -- it can't be both cycleway=lane and bicycle=no.

Based on https://www.dykerbeachgc.com it appears that ""Dyker Beach Golf Course"" is in fact the official name of the course."," Appologies if my changes are against any rules, i was just fixing some splines and building stuff to work with the lidar data importer on TGC2019, offices come over as clubhouses, i was just following a youtube tutorial."," Thanks for getting back to me. The general best practice with OSM is to tag things correctly, not to use incorrect tags to suit the needs of a particular piece of software. But maybe the OSM golf community has decided that's it's appropriate to tag clubhouses as office=yes? If so, it's not documented on the wiki ( https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:leisure%3Dgolf_course ). The suggested tag there is golf=clubhouse. I don't know much about golf, and I don't know what a spline is. But I have an inkling that the sand traps are probably near the end of the hole, not the start, so I think you've fixed the direction of the holes correctly. What about the removal of the name ""Dyker Beach Golf Course""? Is that intentional?"," No problem, and i will keep that in mind in the future i wont mislabel buildings and just do more work in the software itself.  The spline is just the outline of the features which when imported into the software corectly lays out all the features.  The removal of the outline was because it was preventing access to some of the splines, again, my appologies."
 Thanks for the edits but just keep in mind that the state line doesn't always follow the river exactly. Over time the course of the river may change but the state line stays the same.  Just sayin'             ---              Published using OSMCha: https://osmcha.org/changesets/83496434  ," The relationship between boundaries and rivers is an incredibly complicated area of law.  In general, if the river shifts course gradually, the boundary follows the river; if it shifts course abruptly (eg. a flood causes it to settle into a new course), the boundary doesn't. The geography of the Hells Canyon area pretty much ensures that any river movement will be gradual.", Thanks for your comment.

 Please _never_ leave inconsistent coastlines. And one hint: natural=bay is _not_ rendered as water... As soon as coastline data is imported again the _blue_ area will be gone., The documentation said to use natural=bay for inlets which what most of these are. You're saying that won't render as water?, So natural=water instead? , The coastline was following every canal and inlet which didn't conform to other places. I am removing the coastline from individual inlets and connecting it along the mouths of the these inlets. Couldn't find a lot of guidance on this but that is what your referring to? ," You may tag it as natural=water or leave it as natural=coastline. natural=bay is additional info. See wiki: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:natural%3Dbay Unfortunately wiki says, that tagging of natural=bay with relations is invalid. Don't know why... My special interest is of coastlines. I have a check program for that. That's why I recognized the unclosed coastline that early...", btw I installed that coastline checking app. I found the gap.  It was a segment that shows as complete and uploaded on the browser editor but never made it to OSM server. There's actually a few of these. Anyway redoing seems to work.

" Pretty neat, thanks for your contribution! I see this is your first edit, but it is a professional account. I'll assume you're not familiar with iD and OSM in general, sorry if this sounds very basic to you ;) In general, it's best to map things such as parks as areas when possible. With iD, you simply select the ""area"" tool, draw the area and set it to a park. It will show better on the map too. You could put your phone number in the `phone` field (in the left panel, type ""phone"" in the ""Add field"" field). If the space has a dedicated website, you can also add a `website` field. If you have time, it would be great to map the short paths, benches, tables, outdoor gym you talk about (maybe even boards?) You can have a look around https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=41.30897&mlon=-72.94230#map=19/41.30897/-72.94230 to see an example nearby :) Thanks for taking the time to add more data to OSM!

I sent a message to the DWG a couple days ago; still waiting on a response. In the meantime, I'll copy and paste the questions I previously sent him in the edit war threat: 1. Is there anywhere (OSM wiki, mailing list discussion, etc.) where you’ve documented the tagging scheme you are using for rail in Phoenix? 2. Was this tagging scheme developed through discussion with multiple collaborators, or just you? 3. Are there any data consumers (Mapbox, Wikimedia Maps, government agencies, transport agencies, etc.) that depend on Phoenix light rail being tagged as `train` rather than `light_rail`? 4. Are there any data consumers that depend on Phoenix light rail station IDs tagged as `name` rather than `ref`? I think it's fair to say that this warrants a response beyond simply describing Phoenix's live vehical arrival texting system. This is not a feature unique to Phoenix.","  @clay_c  I am just a volunteer.  Sometimes all I have time for is to add one node to the map each day.  That does not mean I am selectively responding to your private messages.  Moreover, in private messages you have come across as bulling. In changeset 82472573 several mappers disagreed with your arm chair mechanical edits.  You had to rollback many of these changes.  You are impacting local knowledge and edits from local mappers. 1. I presented the tagging scheme and its usefulness in August 2018 to the #bus osm.us slack channel.  The channel was just started in May 2018.  I also presented the information to the #general slack channel September 2018. Yet again the edits were presented in the slack channel #imports September 2018. 2. The scheme was developed with another local transit rider TheDutchMan13. Note that Phoenix has a dynamic population.  It is hard to build an active core of mappers because of the movement of people. 3. Valley Metro Org has their own webpage and rider app.  No one depends on the tagging other than a couple of transit users that eat their own dog food.  The existing data consumers have no trouble using the data.  I still add minimal PT version 1 tags to enable this.  Moreover, it is often the case that wiki page names or Q codes do not match the actual on-site information.  The name tag and the wiki tag name can be completely different. 4. More than five years ago I surveyed transit system mapping across the US.  They were all version 1 and largely incomplete.  I am using version 2.  What I found out in practice and use as a local transit rider is that the name tag as it was being used did not actually add any value to using the osm data.  All the name tag gives you is a way to search for a cross street.  Hence, when I have time I go and survey the stops for both bus and rail adding both the alt_name tag for search and the NextRide number for the name.  The NextRide number is more useful when you are trying to catch a train or bus.  It is obvious what the cross streets are when you look at a map.  It is not obvious what the NextRide numbers are.  Burying the NextRide in the ref tag adds no value.  However, after survey I add the NextRide number into both the name and ref tags. Valley Metro Org is a massive system.  That means that it takes time to drive every route with Mapillary to survey all the stops.  The name tag being used for searches lead to abbreviated messes all over the map.  The tagging scheme does allow for evolving to an improved use for data consumers. As I said before, I both live here, use the transit system, and map here.  You are coming off as real demanding as an arm chair mapper. "," Dr Kludge, When I raise questions about someone else's work that I believe needs to be reverted, I _offer for them to revert it first_ before taking it upon myself to revert it. People are usually humble enough to understand what went wrong and take responsibility for it. I appreciate when others reciprocate that favor and give me a chance to revert my own work. In changeset 82472573, I've acknowledged and resolved all the issues with everyone involved, except for the dispute between me and you. I'm disheartened that it's taken you nearly two weeks since then to reveal the reasons you unilaterally reverted my edits. Everything I've said to you in private messages I've laid out in public as well. I'm not even saying your tagging scheme is wrong—this isn't a contest to see who's right. So I'd appreciate it if you'd quit characterizing me as a demanding bully and devaluing my work as ""armchair mapping"". We are both clearly interested in improving the map, and there's no room for that kind of hostility when you're taking responsibility for part of a collaborative project. -Clay", @clay_c  You don't work here. You don't live here.  You don't survey here.  You do not use the transit system here.  That is armchair mapping.  The problem is that you are embarrassed that you were caught doing it.," @clay_c Yes OSM is collaborative. OSM changed building:entrance to the entrance scheme.  I already told you that I have been eating my own dog food.  I found that the use of the name tag for street crossings has limitations.  The crossing information is only for search.  I am using the alt_name tag for that purpose.  Crossings are obvious from a visual review of the map.  They do not need to be spelled out. The real benefit is the NextRide number.  The number can be observed at the same time that the crossing information can be observed.  You are not listening.  It is not just the train route in question here. The whole bus system including the train route has been tagged with the NextRide number for years.  You want to blow away years of work because you have armchair mapped what you think a rider needs.  You ignore local knowledge and continue to refuse a reasonable explanation why the stops in the whole system are tagged the way they are keeping the transit rider in mind.  Please be humble enough to understand that you are engaging in an edit war against local knowledge.  Please stop.  You are taking time away from my other editing. Thanks, Greg "," To be clear, I'm not embarrassed about being an armchair mapper. I actually enjoy doing it from time to time, so your criticisms ring hollow to me. It's helped me forge relationships with lots of mappers around the country. And it doesn't get in the way of my survey mapping either. I'm happy to revisit this issue when things have calmed down. This clearly matters a lot to you, but I can't seem to get anything through to you without you assuming I have some nefarious ulterior motive. The edit war you're talking about is fictional. I haven't touched the Phoenix light rail system for two weeks, and I don't plan to, so why not thank me for stopping instead of begging me to stop? But now I know—it's because you don't consider my work to be work. I've been talking to a brick wall this whole time. I'm bowing out. -Clay"

" Hi wireguy - Thanks for your work on the island. However, I have always seen the mapping of sidewalks as separate ways as not ideal. It complicates walking directions and crowds up the map. For example, look at the south side of Ocean Street on the bay side. The sidewalk just ends halfway down the block and it's not connected to anything. For navigation, this would be a dead end. Instead, I would use the tag sidewalk=(left/right/both) on the actual street. If you don't agree, I'd be glad to discuss it. Don't worry, I am not going to delete your work."," One thing that would be worth keeping is the crossing nodes on streets though -- that is very useful to navigation! Otherwise, take a look at the discussion pages on the wiki for more info on what I'm talking about."," Notice that I didn't start in Holgate.   I wasn't sure how I wanted to handle the patchwork of sidewalks.  In a beach town people just use streets as walkways.   For Beach Haven, I liked separate ways, so curb lower and tactile paving can be expressed where it exists.     I'll pause sidewalk work and go back to covid projects."

" Sequencer, glad to see you helping out. I originally added Yucca Pens to the map. I see you added a number of new ""Roads"". Were you doing this from just the imagery, or do you have experience with the area. I mapped all the roads that were open to vehicular traffic. It looks like the ones you mapped were at best ranger access roads off-limits to the public and some look like they might be fire breaks. My point is that it makes it more difficult for people who are trying to legally navigate the area to find their way. Maybe they should have been tagged as paths rather than roads to make their intended purpose clearer."," Hi! I haven't been there. I just use imagery. Yes, that's a problem if not all roads are open for public use, but the only right solution in such case is a proper access=* tags on all of them. They does not look like just ""path"". How can we do a proper tagging?"," Well I am not sure what the correct tag would be for routes used by rangers that are closed to the public other than setting the vehicle allowed access to private or permit. I THINK it would be permissible to use highway=path and motor_vehicle=permit. That would better convey the intended use which is for hunters to walk on and rangers to patrol on quads or pickups. That would render better also. Do be careful, it is very hard to tell roads (or areas where vehicles have churned up the ground) from fire breaks. In areas like this they run a tractor with a plow to create a 10' wide break in the vegetation to split the region up into squares in case a fire breaks out. They are not usually passable by vehicles as they are very loose sand. They usually look a brighter white than roads. The legal roads are on this map: https://myfwc.com/media/5662/yuccapensunit.pdf"," Actually, if a ""path"" is wide enough for a 4-wheeled vehicle I'd have thought that ""highway=track"" (with appropriate access tags) would be a better bet.  Never been this far south in Florida though..."," I agree with SomeoneElse. If in reality those roads are used by motor vehicles (illegally or not) we have to tag them as highway=track with an appropriate access tags. As I see from satellite imagery those roads are heavily used by offroaders. If there are some cutlines to prevent fires there is also a correct tag for them. BTW, I plan to visit that area after quarantine to see how it looks like"," OK, I will close with this: My only objection to tagging routes passable by vehicles as highway=track that are not on the park map and thus not legal to drive on, is that they will not provide an easy way for users of the standard rendered map to find the legal roads. I think many of the spider webs of trails are from before the land was taken over by the state. Second, and more importantly, many if not most of the tracks mapped, especially in the northern section are actually fire breaks that are not passable except maybe by specialized vehicles. Anything that is a bright even white is pretty much a fire break. Even the well traveled legal tracks show two distinct ruts and shoulders to drain the water. This is more noticeable in the ESRI imagery right now as it is higher res and from the dry season."

Instead, try having a discussion about what is actually correct (like on https://openstreetmap.org/changeset/82132796 - but there I suspect that imagery dates need to be compared).

" Hello, EthanFromJohto, and welcome to OSM. Thanks for your edits. Just a suggestion...you have drawn new objects to the Bing imagery but the streets around your edits don't line up with Bing.

" Hello Importer. Is there any chance you can pause your import and fix some data problems? I see many (most?) of the street addresses aren't properly expanded (i.e ""N Main Street"" instead of ""North Main Street""). I also see a lot of the ways have a node that is duplicated (something like 1-2-3-3-4-5) with the 3 duplicated. It would be great if you could fix those before importing any more, and it would be even better if you could go back and clean up the data already imported. Let me know if you need help. "," Hello, thanks for the feedback.  Yes, I have paused the import and will address these issues before proceeding further.  I am working with another person on the import and they are pausing as well, and we're coordinating on the fix. Thanks again."," We have addressed the issues noted above and proceeded with the import for a few more block groups yesterday. The results are looking good. We will complete the import over the next few days, and then circle back to address open issues in earlier block groups.", Thanks for taking care of this. Much appreciated.
" I took care during the import to only collapse addresses that didn't have accurate locations. Here it looks like they did, and it would have been useful for finding the location of an address within the building. By removing them it feels like you're [tagging for the renderer](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tagging_for_the_renderer)."," My commit message was a bit terse, so let me elaborate a bit. The address nodes were all for units that were on different floors, and they were all just placed next to each other; moreover, they didn't show up in searches (I tested this before making the change). Even if you looked visually at the rendered unit numbers, it was very noisy, and would have been hard to find a unit that way. I used to live in this building, and I can tell you that the way this was set up with address nodes, it would not have been very useful for trying to find an individual unit within the building. Furthermore, having dozens of tags that all have the same street address creates lots of data redundancy, which also makes searching harder. There were lots of problems with the data the way it was; this was not a change that was solely ""for the renderer."""," Other countries have a convention to offset address nodes that are on different floors. Just because Nomanatim can't find addresses with unit numbers doesn't mean it isn't valuable information; another search engine could fix that. I still think worrying about how the information is displayed in Carto is wrong: a better renderer could be smarter about placement or visibility. But if you know that the locations are actually incorrect, then that's okay."

I've repaired those that I can see by adding bicycle=yes, but could you check all those you edited?

" Hi just saw you have been really productive in the area. One little thing I noticed is the house Main Street 609 (https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/784818129). On the Maxar and Bing images it's still visible but in the newer ERSI images, nothing is there anymore. Unfortunatly I didn't make any Mapillary runs last time I was there so I don't have a good source to check. The county of also still lists the property as having two buildings. If you don't know any good source to check, than I'll open a note to remeber to take a look at it, when I'm in the area. Christian "," In current ERSI, it clearly looks gone. I tired all the sources in JOSM, Maxtar didn't have enough resolution. Just now checking Google Maps it shows a building and parking lot, but the fun of sat imagery is not knowing the timestamp. I'll add it back in assuming it's new construction. Yes, it is in the county address data, but often vacant land has an address, so doesn't help."," I know that GMaps imagery isn't as recent as ERSI. I checked at MW (10 miles south east ) and their construction site is already visible in ERSI but not any other image source> I'll add a note to the map. If someone should stumble across it before I can get there it's fine, otherweise I'll check it later Thanks "," I added it back for now, maybe the building and parking got torn down. I added it to my list to validate by vehicle when it's safe to be out and traveling.", Please don't look at Google Maps/Imagery when doing this sort of thing. It is against the terms & conditions of both Google & OpenStreetMap. I know it's tempting but there's a risk that all the change may need to be deleted. SK53," I just added what was there back since it does have an address. As a free-software developer I'm very conscious of licensing, and only checked Google in this case since there was a discrepancy. But no data came from there, ie.. I didn't add the parking lot."," I know SK53 I didn't use GMAPS as a reference, I was just curious whether it has more recent data than ERSI or BIng or Maxar"," Even if it's for a discrepancy try & avoid it, or make a point of replacing sneaking a peek at Gmaps with a visit to the area. If you do do it, its best to be discrete :-) (and yes I know this is a way out of town & unlikely anyone can get there now)"," I'm not sure how often the various imagery providers do updates.

 Is access really no? For a school access=private seems more appropriate.," I was wondering about that myself. Wiki seemed to indicate access was more of a default when used in combination with other specific permissions. e.g. ""access=no, foot=yes, bicycle=yes"" in a couple of these cases. I can definitely change these, but especially when they're signed ""pedestrian access only"" I felt the specific permissions were the key thing."
" Is this a path connecting a residential neighbourhood to a main road? I imagine it should be tagged access=private, not access=no.

" To expand on the issues I'm having with roads in Sugar House...2100 S west of 1300 and 1300 E south of 2100 are clearly the main roads through the area, and should be primary. Wilmington is clearly more important than all the other unclassified roads in the area, and should be tertiary. However, 1100 E/Highland is what's causing the issues. North of 1700 S, 1100 E is clearly tertiary, and it's definitely secondary south of 1700 S. However, this makes the secondary road stop at a weird place (a tertiary road). What's more, the part of Highland north of 215 is definitely secondary, but the part south of 215 I think should be tertiary (horrible traffic light timing at 2700 S and 1300 E, and better routes nearby in 1300 E and 900 E). But if I make the road tertiary, then it puts on equal importance to Wilmington, which is clearly incorrect. Any suggestions? In my edits here, I solved the second issue by making 1300 E primary between Highland and I-215, but it seems like a hack to me... I'm also having issues with where to end the secondary classification on the east side of South Temple. Directly east of 700 E, it's definitely still secondary. But by the time it reaches 1300 E, it's definitely only tertiary. But there's no obvious place in between to switch classification. Thoughts?"

" Hi! Great to see the work you've been doing and thanks in particular for adding surface tags - these make a big difference. I'd suggest you have a bit of a look at best practice elsewhere on highway classifications. highway=primary certainly shouldn't be used for unpaved county roads in the US - it's used for US routes and for the most important State routes. For unpaved roads you'll almost always want highway=unclassified, or highway=tertiary at a pinch if it's a very good quality one (but this is most applicable in the Midwest where there are few other roads). Paved county roads could be highway=tertiary or highway=unclassified - a good road with a centreline is more likely to be =tertiary.  Richard"

" Hi LegalTrailsOnly, welcome to OSM. May we know the reason behind deleting many mapped trails in this area? Thanks.

" WTF!?  Who are YOU to say these ""don't exist"" when you only assert they are not ""LegalTrailsOnly.""  I'm reverting this vandalism of redaction and you should be ashamed of your OSM self.", they are illegal trails you will be ticketed for riding them and they shouldnâ€™t be advertised on OSM.," They are trails and they have every right to be mapped, especially as they are mapped with access=no.  If you KNOW that trails are ""illegal"" then tag them as such with access=no. However, you may NOT remove them from OSM with a heavy-handed, ""let's make what truly exists invisible"" attitude like you are the ""trail police."" These are not being ""advertised"" in OSM.  They are being ""stated as existing"" in OSM.  That's all a map does:  it asserts the existence of a feature.  You are welcome to ""richen up"" any feature on the map with an additional tag that adds an additional semantic (like access=private or access=no), but you may NOT simply delete these from the map. I am not the only person in OSM watching your activities to assure you don't continue to do this.  Please abide by what OSM is:  a MAP.  OSM is not your mother shaking her finger at you, a fence, the police or God issuing a Commandment.  So, please, don't delete, rather, tag properly."

" This edit removes a way that represents a trail.  The trail was added long ago based on strava, and no mapper has ever seen it.  The  land is now posted no trespassing, so 1) any use of what might exist is unlawful and 2) more importantly, mappers are prohibited from verifying if there is or isn't a trail.   All in all, based on discussion with other active local mappers and landowner representatives I think this phantom maybe-trail shouldn't be on the map, speaking as the local osm steward of this area.  Please feel free to message me if you are upset by this."," @gdt If the trail doesn't exist any more (or perhaps never really did) then I think that removing it makes perfect sense.  I've certainly removed Strava ""trails"" that following a survey turned out to be not paths at all, just short-cuts over walls and fences or worse.  Where the trail is visible on aerial imagery it might make sense to keep it as highway=track or whatever, but with access=private on it to stop anyone else adding it without an access tag in the future, but (with the Strava ones that I removed on the other side of the Atlantic) that wasn't the case. Best Regards, Andy"
" Hi pwhite119, welcome to OSM. May we know the reason behind deleting more than 300 mapped buildings? Thanks.

 Landuse=grass is used for smaller grassy area to service no other purpose such as a median between roads. https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:landuse%3Dgrass," Hi contributor, as you can see, I was going for an Apple Maps style cartography design where the purpose of the grass is to tag it on grassy areas like these or in areas with alot of trees are being tagged with forest.

" I'm just curious, but what was bogus about the Lockeport data? Have most of the buildings in Lockeport been demolished?

I mean they really look fake: 10 neighboring buildings with distinct layouts discernible in high-resolution imagery all had the same building outline according to Dartmouthmapmaker.

" Hello Gabriel0322, not everything where a pedestrian can walk is a footpath. Much as pedestrians can cross a meadow anywhere they like, they can also traverse a graveyard.

 Van Buren is a Charter Township.  What's the best way to update the name?," Hi Michael, Thanks for your comment. I agree with you that Van Buren Township is a Charter Township. I used what I'm guessing is the common default name, ""Van Buren Township"", rather than ""Van Buren Charter Township"" which appears on the township's web site. Wikipedia says that the official name is ""Charter Township of Van Buren"". The OSM wiki for key:name suggests several variations on name tags alt_name and official_name. I would be completely happy with three name tags: name=Van Buren Township, alt_name=Van Buren Charter Township, and official_name=Charter Township of Van Buren. If you feel that name=Van Buren Charter is the best choice, I believe you have solid reasons for changing the existing tag and I would not object at all. In that case, I'd also add either short_name=Van Buren Township or alt_name=Van Buren Township. When I first started editing townships, I used the full official name; see Washtenaw County. I think shorter names would look better and not detract from the usefulness of the map. I have been intending to go back and shorten those names, retaining the existing versions as alt_name or official_name tags. Tip: use a non-breaking space between Van and Buren so that those components of the name won't appear on different lines when rendered on the map. Interesting fact: Only Michigan has Charter Townships. You are welcome to change the name tags if you wish, or if you prefer that I do it, let me know. Thanks, mapper377"

Try searching with the editor's preset menu. If there's no appropriate preset, try searching at https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/ and if that fails, you can add a description to the object. Also, you duplicated the other three places you added as both areas and points. Please only add one or the other."
" Requested review: Thank you for your contributions. They are helpful! :-) A couple issues I noticed: From how you mapped it, it's not clear what Dermatology Associates of York is, besides a building. Perhaps it's a doctors' office or clinic? You can switch it to a more specific preset by clicking ""Building"" at the top of the sidebar in the editor and using the search. Also, regarding the York JCC, which you mapped in another changeset, it was already there as an area, but it was missing the name. You should have made changes to that instead to avoid duplication. I went ahead and merged the point you added with the area and made some fixes to the area, which had its own problems. Namely, I removed the building tag and mapped the building separately, and I expanded the outline to include a big chunk that was missing. I've never been there, so I hope I got the outline right. Could you confirm whether https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/539350813 now has the correct outline of the campus, and fix it or tell me if I got it wrong? Thanks again.

In other words, if you are adding a street, your edit is just a line until you add a tag showing that it is a residential road or a driveway or a parking aisle, or whatever kind of road. The same is true of your edits a few days ago that are supposed to be ponds but you ignored my comments on that changeset. Bottom line...if you want your edits to show up on the map you must add the proper tags."
" Are some of these buildings meant to be completely untagged? From the imagery they appear to be houses so I’ve been updating them with that tag, but if you are holding off in tagging them for some reason let me know and I won’t update any more of these."," My modus operandi is switching between the ""b"" tool for simple building shapes and the usual line tool for more complex buildings.  As the former adds building tags automatically it does happen that I forget adding the tags for the latter, usually the JOSM validator warns about those cases and I fix them before uploading, but it does happen that they slip through. If there is a reason for me to keep outlines without tags I usually write that down with the ""note"" tag. So go forward."," Understood, going forward if there’s no note on it I’ll just add the missing tags."

" Hi Falynn99, Welcome to OSM! Nice job on your first few edits! I just wanted to send you some real quick feedback about the paths you're adding. When you add footways, using more than one line is quite acceptable. If a path splits, it's normally best to use at least two (connected) lines to draw it rather than zig-zagging back and forth trying to include both diverging pathways in one go. It's also good to include where the footway connects to adjacent roads so that routing software can use the paths you're adding more easily. I've made some changes so that you can see what I'm talking about, but they could probably do with even more improvement Anyway - thanks again for your contributions! Happy mapping :) P.S. I also have a question about the basketball court - you've got a path cutting right through it. The path looks correct on the available imagery, but the court is also mapped as having 6 hoops and being much wider than it appears - do you know what's happening there? "

Also looks like some turn lanes on the approach to exit 23 was wiped out.

With my last drive my Tesla did good and dint  Yes the HOV offramp bridge starts a bit further north, I moved it a bit further southeast than needed in an attempt to solidify that lane as a separate entity. Feel free to move it further north again but ideally the cars should pick those HOV lanes quite a ways before they split. Here is where the ramp really starts raising. https://www.google.com/maps/place/33%C2%B046'30.6%22N+118%C2%B005'12.1%22W/@33.775165,-118.0872545,312m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d33.7751649!4d-118.0867063"," Yeah, I think we were trying to solve the same problem.   If you open in Id and have the background set to Bing, does that imagery match what you're seeing on the ground?  I honestly only go through that interchange maybe once or twice every ten years myself since I moved away."," OK, I doublechecked it against Mapillary imagery from January to confirm and updated based on what I saw. Also looking at this more and working knowledge of how interstates work, I'm thinking 605 departs from 405, not 22, and the ramps between 22 and 605 are just ramps?"," It looks like the change you made may have broken the Tesla autopilot FSD navigation again at this interchange.  Ive been traveling this road every day for the past 5 years and have been using the carpool lane exclusively with the Tesla for the past 6 months. The 1st couple months my car would always try and get in the wrong far left lane which goes to the 605 instead of staying on the rightmost HOV lane. After I found out the car uses openstreetmaps for much of the navigation I started making updates and it finally started taking the correct route. Will take another look at it tonight, may try moving that ramp a little more eastbound because that seemed to help."," I might also recommend doublechecking with Tesla on this one before going for that, there's no reason it shouldn't be able to handle the way it's mapped now."," Yeah, looking at it now, it looks like the mapping is now bugged.  If that fixed your Tesla, the map should still be fixed to match reality and you need to work with Tesla to fix a bug on their side."

 Please alert me if I made a mistake when removing description tags. ," Hi TravGW -- please don't perform these continent-sized mass edits. They are very difficult for both humans and software to process. I consider your motive, reducing description tag spam, to be a good one, but this is not a good way to go about it.  Some mappers I'm familiar with from my area (NYC) like to use wordy descriptions. That doesn't equal advertisement. I don't know what criteria you used to select these description tags for deletion, but I suspect it's just based on field length without any attempt to examine or communicate with the users in question. I attempted to revert this changeset with changeset 81755045 but failed -- possibly there are too many changes for the JOSM reverter plugin to handle. All the more reason to use smaller changesets, both geographically and in number of edits. Thanks, Jason", I suppose I should have done a few hundred at a time since it covers such a large area.  For this changeset I loaded all nodes in question into JOSM and used the ToDo plugin to review each and every one. Any tag that read like a advertisement was removed. Any tag that I was unsure of was left alone. I would never perform a purely mechanical edit. Too much paperwork involved for those.," Thanks for the quick reply TravGW -- I'm happy to hear you did check these manually. But I'd appreciate if you attempted to contact the users in question first, at least those who seem legit. I know that sorting out who's a real mapper with a penchant for adspeak and who's just an SEO bot is hard work. I know because I've done a lot description tag cleanup myself. But it hurts the community to undo the work of real mappers without any communication.  At first glance I think the vast majority of the changes are for the better. But there are definitely some descriptions you've removed that were written in good faith. Some of these might benefit from a less spammy rewording. Maybe some of them really should be deleted, good faith notwithstanding! But if they were added by real people, an attempt at communicating with those people is better than a mass tag deletion. Thanks, J"," I'm with jmapb, changesets like this should be split into at least one per state with possible exceptions for combining e.g. Delaware with Maryland and DC, Rhode Island with Connecticut and Massachusetts, Vermont with New Hampshire and possibly Maine."," having just reviewed 28 of these, the nature of these nodes as potential spam means a good number of them will be candidates for purging entirely after an in-depth review of all details and not just the altered description. as such, knowing i'd probably be strung up for deleting known and obvious spam, i'd not be using any tool but clicking on all 1'045 notes listed below - and this time not in `lynx' where i work faster without the overhead of a graphical browser, since if an alleged business is nowhere near the given address, or if it looks like a residential neighbourhood for what appears to be a service rather than a storefront, then i feel the node has no place in osm.  particularly if it's an advert for an app as one of the links i posted in the attempted revert. so in my case i care more about the changeset volume, and not at all the area. a multiple of 20 items is good as each page below (or better on the revert mini-changeset) shows obviously the place-of-warship spammage, there on the first page. i gave rough estimates as to the amount of useless spam and the amount of legit descriptions that i could review, but i've the suspicion those numbers are not representative. as i seem to caught a case of the corona-insomnia, i'm tempted to page through the 500+ pages listing below.  in the hopes i pass out or die before reaching the end to pronounce judgment. i need a life.  or a hobby.", Id argue most of these are wrongly using the name tag as a descriptor also. Instead of being used for the actual name of the object. , Most of the names look okay but I question the need to repeat the full business name for a Bitcoin ATM.," Agreed, but then you just have name=Bitcoin Atm. How's that not descriptive?", Maybe dispense with name=* entirely and just use brand=* and whatever additional tag(s) to indicate it's for Bitcoin.
 Hi there. It seems that in this changeset it appears that you wrongly added some driveways as footpaths and residential roads.

So I'd appreciate it if you could review your edits and fix the mistakes.  Thanks," Hi Adamant1, Thank you for the feedback! After looking over at this changeset again, I believe I did not add any new ways or modify any tags. The only changes I've made in this changeset was adjusting the nodes of pre-existing ways.

It seems I originally added way 776203456, but that's not typically a mistake I would make. As I'm pretty good about not creating none existing paths.

I'm currently going through and updating all the golf courses in my area, primarily so that i can take the data in OSM into a course designer program and recreate the course.

Yeah, it will need to be reverted in order to retrieve the leisure=golf_course areas and so that we can maintain the changeset histories. I appreciate the work you're doing, however. Just FYI, some of the edits you've created don't quite comply with the OSM wiki pages concerning golf courses. For example, holes don't normally have names. Take a look here: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:golf%3Dhole  Also, ""Littleton - Hole 2 - Rough"" wouldn't be a name. Littleton wouldn't be used in any event since the parts of the golf course will all exist within the confines of the leisure=golf_course area. ""Rough"" wouldn't be stated either since this is a description, not a name. ""Hole 2"" would not be a name, but a ref. The ref would simply be ""2"".

 Hello. It would have cool if you hadn't have screwed with 44 and the all the bridges.  You ended up moving most of the junctions way further down the freeway then they actually where and you moved the bridge going across the Sacramento bridge so it's smaller then it actually is. Everything was fine before you edited it. Now it's going to be a massive hassle to fix. At least next time don't edit so many things at once. At it just makes your edits that much more convoluted. , Same goes for i5," Yo Adamant1, comments like this aren't very helpful. If you don't have constructive feedback, don't bother leaving a comment."," Yo Indees, what the hell are you talking about and why are you even commenting in the first place? I'm not sure what's unconstructive about pointing out when someone maps something wrong. People do it all the time. Same goes for asking people to make smaller changests so they are easier to review. Neither is a big deal. Not that it matters, but I've lived along this stretch of road most of my life and drive it every day. As such, I know from actual daily experience where the junctions are located. As such,  I have every right to leave someone a changeset comment saying their edit was wrong so it doesnt happen again. Especially if its an edit from someone that's not local, doesn't account for local mapping preferences. Removing useful tags and arbitrary moving things that were fine already in the process. As was the case here and has happened multiple times already with the freeways in this area. Which I've had to correct many times due to similar things.  Generally, it seems like you have a real thing for tone policing by calling out people on things that you know zero about and that aren't actually issuses. Which is the epitome of not being constructive. Tone policing never goes anywhere and it usually just pisses people off. So, maybe just skip it next time.

 Welcome to OSM! If you add a building you didn't need an additional tag area=yes.
 Please pay attention to the placement=* tags and other lane tagging; you moved some ramps so the lanes no longer line up properly.

 Nice work!  I recall walking this almost 40 years ago and I appreciate the update to the tagging.
" Hi RangerMankin, welcome to OSM! I'm Brooklyn-based myself and it's always great to see a new mapper in the hood. In this changeset you've made slight adjustments to a lot of building footprints. My advice is to do this with caution. The footprints were all imported from the NYC dept of buildings database and though they're not perfect, they are in general pretty good. If you see a lot of imported buildings that are slightly offset from the aerial imagery in the same direction, it's much more likely that the imagery you're using is misaligned, rather than that the city mismeasured all of those buildings. The best-aligned aerial imagery in the NYC area is the ""NYS Orthos Online"" which is published by New York State. If you switch to this layer you'll probably see that most of the building footprints match the aerial photos pretty well. (Note that the footprints sometimes don't include overhangs and awnings.) The ESRI World Imagery layer is also useful -- it's actually the same imagery as the NYS Orthos with better resolution. But the alignment is a little off, and even varies a bit between zoom levels. The most up-to-date imagery currently is the MapBox Satellite, but it's misaligned pretty severely. It's also taken at an angle so the tops of buildings are displaced from the footprints, especially taller ones. Let me know if you have any questions about the map, happy to help. Jason", Thank you very much for the clarification. I started noticing after making adjustments that they were ALL “off” and started to get suspicious. I started researching and realized I must be missing something. I will definite use the resources you mentioned and really appreciate you taking the time to let me know.," Thanks, and if you don't mind, I'd like to move some of the items back to thier original location. It's not hard to do as long as nobody else has moved them around in the mean time. Regarding the aerial imagery, it looks like my info's out of date. Earlier this year I checked the Bing imagery and it was several years old, but it's recently been updated and seems to be from last summer. So Bing is now the most current in NYC. The alignment's not great but I've realigned it using an offset of 0.86,-1.38 and that seems to work pretty well, at least in Brooklyn. Unknown at this point if it drifts around in other parts of the city. (The NYS Orthos is still valuable because the alignment's close to perfect -- close enough that I don't bother trying to tweak it -- and because it was shot in the winter so has much less tree cover. The Mapbox imagery's still useful too, especially for seeing details on taller buildings.) ", No problem at all. And I’ll definitely hit you up if I have more questions. I’m mainly looking to build out my local neighborhood and the various parking lots around town to help Teslas with Autosummon. This is a great project and happy to have discovered it.
" The road looks like it should be a service road. If its named then I'd call tag it as a residential. Unclassified is actually just like a city residential road, but for rural areas.

It looks backwards to me, but I'm guessing you know this area so I'll leave it to you.  I did round the drop off loop. There is no easy way. What I do is draw a triangle over the loop, then right click on make a circle of out it.

I waver in how I treat compound parking lots like this because it doesn’t seem like there’s a clear convention. "

" Hey Natfoot, I'm not sure separate ways are the best way to represent the Ravenna Blvd bike lanes. They're not really physically separated from a cyclist's perspective, as cyclists can easily merge out of them, across the paint-and-post buffer zone, into another lane. Additionally, the rationale for mapping sidewalks separately mostly doesn't apply to bike lanes: whereas separately-mapped sidewalks can have barriers like curbs accurately placed on them, to better route i.e. people in wheelchairs, cycling doesn't have a comparable issue. I don't see the benefit for having them as separate lanes. However, if you're really set on having separate ways for bike lanes, would you change the cycleway tag on the neighboring roadway to cycleway=separate? As is currently mapped, we have two map features for each real-life feature. This is especially noticeable on Open Cycle Map. Thanks!"

To correct the same, I've added the driveways under changeset #81496886 Regards, chepteja"," hallo chepteja and the rest of the amazon team, this is just general info about how OSM likes to handle old data and accidental deletions like this. while you have added the driveways deleted, this was very simply done by drawing them from nothing, so that in https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81496886 there are links to three ways, but none of them, at v1, will have the original history and credit to the original mapper that can be seen only by following the links below to the deleted way, such as https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/756751719/history . there are tools available that can restore accidentally deleted ways, preserving the history and linking all previous edits. i know amazon has reported they are planning to migrate editing tools due to deficiencies in the iD editor when deployed on such a large scale; JOSM is often suggested as it has the ability to selectively revert parts of an accidental changeset as this.  alternatively, other mappers have access to script tools that can do the same thing, and are willing to apply them in cases like this, as i've just done in a repeat case of deliberate vandalism. we appreciate you adding back what you deleted, and do want you to know there is a `better' way to do it, that again is a tradeoff between an advanced mapper skill, and what can be expected from entry-level or limited mappers. thanks"

 Welcome to OSM! Thanks for adding the address! I add some additional highways and buildings around your address.
" Hey, I got rid of the name=West Redding tag. As again, the name tag isn't suppose to be used a descriptor. Plus, it's not really accurate anyway. A lot of things could be considered ""west Redding"" and what is or isn't is rather arbitrary. Which is I never tagged the area like that when  I was mapping it. Same goes for similar things like ""old town"", ""downtown"", ""Mt. Shasta Mall Area"", ""Enterprise Area"", and other unofficial or not actually existing ""divisional areas"" of town. Otherwise, it's leads to the whole arbitrary mapping and edit warring thing I was telling you about. There's a ton of none official ways the city could be divided up into, but it's better just not to open that can of worms, or if we do, it should at least be discussed and planned first.  At some point I plan to create a Wiki page for Shasta County. Things like that and any future imports could probably be planned and coordinated there first. That's how OSM usually prefers it. "," Btw, I've noticed that you have mostly been doing mapping of other things besides sidewalks since you did the import. While I can understand doing cleanup probably isn't high on your priority list, one of the requirements of imports is that you fix any errors in them after doing it. In this case, it's particularly important sidewalks are mapped correctly because  they play an important role in navigation and a lot of them are messed up now. For instance, a lot are navigation islands that cant be routed through, especially in neighborhoods. Which should really be fixed by connecting them to the road network at crossings. There's also a lot of little sidewalk ""stubs"" around that should be deleted and sidewalks that where imported over already existing ones. So, I'd appreciate if you spent some time dealing with those things and cleaning up any other problems that might have been caused by the import. Thanks"," Alright. I might disagree with you about ""Downtown"" as there is an official area, but otherwise that makes sense. Maybe some subdivisions like Vin Knolls which have a single collector road. As for the sidewalks, I'm in the process of reverting my changesets. The data is iffy and probably not worth the work. "

 Hello! I revert your change set because you change the tag highway=cycleway to addr:street=cycleway.  , Thank you! How can I add a cycle route into that area of Sherman Ave?, Hello! There is a difference between adding a highway to a bicycle route (like https://www.osm.org/relation/9135298 (but this isn't a good example)) and adding the information on the highway exists a cycleway (https://wiki.osm.org/wiki/Key:cycleway) and mark the highway as cycleway (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dcycleway).What's your issue?," Hi Michaela, thanks for editing. I'm in the denver area and am pretty familiar with the neighborhood. What is it you are trying to accomplish exactly? Cycle route relations are typically used for large routes that span cities or states, while individual tags on the way such as ""cycleway=shared_lane"" are used to indicate how a cyclist can use a particular road."," Haha, sorry, this is Sherman and Congress in NJ, not CO, they look similar up close. :) Either way, same comment - Sherman Ave. here doesn't really look like a cycle route to me, though cycleway=shared_lane may be an appropriate tag if cyclists are allowed/expected to share the traffic lane with cars."," Thank you all for your help! Brand new to OSM over here, but learning quickly :) I was cross-referencing what I see in Google Maps when I filter by Bicycle in Jersey City.  According to Google Maps there was a hard green line on Sherman Ave which means there's a dedicated bike path. I believe I was just not using the correct tags here to label the type of route."," Hi, we don't copy anything from Google Maps - both because it is a violation of Google and OSM's licenses, but also because Google is often wrong (a good reason to have a community edited map!). In this case, looking at the aerial imagery sources, Sherman does not appear to have any  cycle infrastructure, unless some was very recently added. I removed the cycle relation and the cycleway since they don't seem to exist. If I'm wrong, and there is a dedicated bike lane there that you can confirm locally, then instead of stacking two ways on top of each other or using a relation, you would add the correct cycleway tag to the main road way. See this guide for a list of cycleway tags used to describe different types of bike routes on a road. https://github.com/BikeOttawa/OSM-Bike-Ottawa-Tagging-Guide/blob/master/README.md", Thank you for this!

" Hey, it  you mapped you the bus platform relation wrong. It wouldn't involve the office or bathrooms. Mostly just footway area. Since that's where people stand to wait for the bus. Not in the office. I'd say to that the roofs wouldn't count as the platform either. Since they are separate objects and should be mapped as such (see One feature, one OSM element in the wiki). Although the footway could technically be extended under them. Which I'll probably do. Personally, if the intent is to show that buses stop there, a better way to do it would be tag each bus stop as an individual highway=bus_stop node instead. That would then allow the bus stop #'s and specific bus systems (since there's like three) to be mapped individually. Where as with this way you can't really do that. You could then also add shelter=yes. Some stops, like the amtrak bus, aren't technically sheltered. So it's important not to clump the whole thing together as one homogeneous element. I had actually planned to do it that way at some point, I just haven't gotten around to it yet.  Anyway, thanks. "," Btw, arbitrarily turning things into relations just for the sake of it is generally not a good idea. Since it's a massive pain to get rid of the relation and re-map stuff if it turns out wrong. So, you might want to watch out for that and not use a ""these objects look related to me. So I'll make them a relation"" standard (not that I'm saying that's what you did here). "," I see. I think that may have been a JOSM thing. I don't recall making the relationship for those roofs. I did change some of the tagging on the bus stop to be a bit more accurate but I agree it's not quite up to snuff. I've been meaning to ground survey the area and make it a bit more kosher. I have learned a bit more about relations since and I'm practicing on some simpler stuff like parking lots/parking spaces.

I'm just curious. And even though most of US 24 between Limon and Colo Spgs is 2-lane, I don't really have any problem with it being mapped as trunk."," I would also like to know why aboges26 changed these highways to Trunk. I know from personal experience that these are not trunk roads for most of their length. Incorrect Trunks include US50, US24 from Vail through CS to Limon, US160, CO17, US285."," I see what you mean, CrazyMonkeyBen. I was not aware that all of those had been changed to Trunk. I wonder if aboges26 is using traffic volume data or just picked out what they thought were very important? I also noticed that CR 110 had been added to the ref for CO 17 (shortcut off US 285 in the San Luis Valley down to Alamosa). I don't recall ever seeing CR 110 signed on that road. If it is technically a reference, it is an unsigned_ref as far as I know (unless the county or CDOT has added it, but I can't imagine why they would)."
 That's how it is in California. In Florida we have different standards., Alright thank you for letting me know, Thank you.

" Hi Pixel3011, welcome to OSM. May we know the source of your mapping? Thanks."
" What's with the micromapping of the roads? The name tag isn't meant to be used as a way to describe something like your using it here. It should only be used for names. Anyway, its uncessary to describe what roads the road is between, people can tell by looking at the map. Plus, it just pointlessly adds clutter.", Good point. I'll leave them unnamed
" Hey, I thought the sidewalks on Tehama and California along the construction zone are either closed or none existent at this point."," Btw, the current offset in town for most things is set to the Esri World Imagery. It would be good if that's what is used when mapping  and adjusting things so everything isn't constantly having to be readjusted. Plus, it's the best imagery for most things anyway. Thanks. "," Yeah, you're right. I changed them to be under construction. I've been using the ESRI clarity layer, which is pretty similar to the ESRI World Imagery at the highest zoom level but I'll just use the default if that's what you think will work better"

" Hi, just a heads up, these schools have what are called school grounds (they show up yellow) that surround the main building.

Why did you overwrite the ameinty=school and the building key with area? Did you know the difference between layer and level and building:level?," @omnific thanks for your feedback. I understand not wanting duplicates, but if the school buildings aren't assigned names it means that they can't be identified when exported through OSM Buildings. Is there a work around for this issue?"," One of the key rules is never to ""tag for the renderer"", which OSM buildings essentially is in this case. OSM buildings is third party software, and therefore should not be used as the basis for changing the core OSM dataset. We had similar issues with people changing data to make certain things happen in the game PokÃ©mon Go. I'd submit a request to whoever maintains that software to add a conflation algorithm to conflate the names from the amenity=school area onto the biggest building within the bounds of the school area or just add the school areas directly to the map.

" Hi, What exactly is at this address? If it is not a location where people can drop off their dry cleaning in person it should not be tagged with shop=dry_cleaning.

Also please note that OpenStreetMap tags are not for ad copy! name=* should contain the name (of your business in this case) -- that's it. description=* should contain additional information, but never advertising or similar rubbish verbiage."

" Should Edgewater be mapped as a city? It certainly doesn't have the population or amenities that would indicate a city. Just because it has 'city' in the name doesn't mean it should be mapped as one; otherwise, all incorporated municipalities in states like Idaho would be cities and the map would be cluttered."," Hello. Thank you for your question. From my perspective, it is irrelevant whether Edgewater is mapped as a city or not. OSM does not have strict guidelines as to what defines a place as a city. However, OSM does have an ""on the ground"" rule. Edgewater officially refers to itself as a city, whether people outside the city consider the place a city or not. In addition, the state government of Colorado also considers Edgewater to be a city. Colorado state government has a list of metropolitan districts, towns and cities. In this list, Edgewater is listed as a city. So, using the OSM ""on the ground"" rule, and based on the definitions used by Edgewater and the state of Colorado, Edgewater is a city. https://www.cleargov.com/colorado https://www.edgewaterco.com"," the `on-the-ground' rule doesn't refer to definitions and terms used by other sites, but to how a disinterested mapper, when confronted by the object in question, would choose to map it in osm terms going by osm definitions. there are plenty of so-called parks referred to by other authorities that do not qualify as osm urban parks, to pick an obvious example.  the definitions used by these outside authorities are irrelevant to osm, and have nothing to do with the on-the-ground rule that excludes third-party influences. i have no opinion here as i use everyday words like town or city to refer to things that clearly are not, in casual speech, as for me these are destinations, and not as distinguishing categories.  also different languages distinguish the terms differently, so i say `city' to mean a compact village that is clearly not the surrounding not-village."

" Hello, welcome to OSM and thank you for your contributions. Re: the 7-11 at East 17th Avenue & Pearl Street. Was there a compelling reason for removing the business node and adding the business name to the building outline? Thank you"," Hi chachafish, Isn't the entire building 7-Eleven? I was merging business nodes with the building they're contained in when there is only one business in the building. If this is a mistake, let me know and I'll restore the node. I've only been by it once and that was a few years ago, but it seemed like it was clearly the only occupant in the building."," Hello, thank you for your response. Whether the entire building is occupied solely by one entity isn't really the issue. It's equally correct to place a business node within the confines of the building outline or to add the business to the building outline. Neither method is preferred in OSM. The issue is that since neither method is preferred, there's no need to remove the work of other mappers, i.e., the node here did not need to be removed. Thank you again for your additions to the map :)", No work is being deleted; no tags are being removed and no information is lost.," Hello, thank you, but I think maybe you are missing the point of my question. My original question was, was there a compelling reason for removing the business information located in the node and adding the same information to the building outline? The node, created about six years ago, was mapped correctly. Why change this, correct, mapping method? Is this because you prefer your style over someone else's? Thank you :)", I would say that information is being added as the moving of the tags to the area indicates that it is the sole occupant whereas the node only indicates that 7-Eleven occupies part of the building. So I would say that the addition of data is a compelling reason. There is no 'wrong' way to map real things and I think that my method adds information that was not previously there.," Hello, thank you for your response. I cannot say I agree or disagree with your position as to whether your method adds or doesn't add information that was previously there. I simply follow OSM guidelines and I'm not aware of any OSM guidelines that agree with your position, although if they exist I would certainly be interested in reading them. I would be concerned that making changes to work that is already mapped correctly, according to the OSM Wiki, might lead to edit wars. As for me, even though I might have a mapping style that is at odds with what another mapper has mapped correctly before me, unless OSM guidelines clearly indicate my changes are an improvement, I refrain from making changes. That's just me. Otherwise, I would fully expect the previous mapper might take issue with my edits and change them back. Without a clearly stated position from the OSM Wiki, I wouldn't really have a leg to stand on. Thank you :)"
" Just a heads up, you have made some edits along I 405 Northbound that don't exactly jive with what's on the ground.  Please pay special attention to placement=* other lane tagging, particularly where ramps join and leave the main roadway.  The segment tagged placement=transition takes you from the physical gore to the end of the painted gore.", Alright thank you for letting me know
" Hi OneC -- can you describe what you're doing in this changeset? It looks like you just added new nodes to existing streets without changing geometry or tagging. Thanks, jmapb"
" Hi liulanzheng, welcome to OpenStreetMap and thanks for your additions! You've selected the ""review requested"" feature on these changes, and I do have some questions and comments, if you'd like to discuss. Thanks, jmapb"," Hi jmapb, Thank you for your time reviewing my edit. what were your questions and comments? Thanks, liulanzheng"," It looks like you removed the building at the corner of 9th Ave and 60th St and replaced it with two smaller builings: https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/772458088 https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/772458091 Are these actually new buildings occupying the space where the larger building used to be? I don't see any indication from the department of buildings that this building has been replaced with two smaller ones, but sometimes this DOB data lags behind actual construction.", I didn't check the DOB before I made this change. It was based on the street view. It's my mistake. I'll change it now. Thank you for pointing this out.," Of course, sometimes buildings do get demolished and new ones put in their place! When possible we try to keep the buildings tagged with the DOB info but sometimes the data's not available. Next question: Does Perfect Furniture and Lighting occupy the entire building? If not, it's usually better to just map it as a single node (point) inside the building, like you did for this restaurant: https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/7212724466", I'll fix it right now. Thank you so much for the suggestions!

 Can you provide me some evidence that WA 166 extends beyond the eastern city limits of Port Orchard?
 When was that designated WA-907?  The state Department of Transportation doesn't seem to know anything about it.," I'm going to remove the ref tags, as you've provided no evidence that WA 907 exists."
 Please don't tag a road as a motorway unless it actually is a freeway (e.g. I-5). I'd appreciate it if you changed these roads that you erroneously tagged motorway back to how they were before. Thanks!

" Hi, What is your source for these changes? You are changing things that I surveyed myself in the last few months, so I know that they are wrong."," I'm sorry, that was rude of me to say your source was wrong. What I meant was that I am puzzled at the discrepancies between my survey and your source. "," no worries. I'm using GPS traces that i made a while ago. Trying to clean out my backlog. I may be out of date. Sorry if I ""incorrected"" anything."," Ah, I've thought about trying to get speed limit data out of GPS traces. What software do you use for it if I might ask? I'll go ahead and fix the roads I surveyed recently.", I use OSMTracker. I use a custom dashboard so that I can hit a button for the speed limit change (or surface transition) right as I get to the speed limit sign (or surface transition). I'm usually pretty accurate. Can you tell me what I got wrong in this one?," Yeah, Oak Hill Road in Northfield is 35 mph, not 30. It changes speed limits at the town line. You can see the sign on the streetside imagery too. I'll check out that program!"," OK. Thank you.  OSMTracker can be found in f-droid, but you need the one that is v 0.7.2 or later in order to upload. Its also on the Play store, but you want the one by ""Laboratorio Experimental."" Any older version has been abandoned by the original maintainer. If you want, I can send you my config file (or post it here). It's pretty useless with the stock configuration."," Thanks for catching the mistake, btw. I do my best to be accurate, but sadly perfection continues to elude me."," As it does us all! Again, sorry about the grief at the top. Thinking too much about having to plow the snow tonight and not enough about being polite and clear in my speech, haha."," No worries at all. I know the feeling. I'd like to tell people not to use ""paved"" when the surface is ""asphalt"" but I don't know how to tell who did what tag."," that would be an easy one to point out if one of the below that i looked at had that change, but i didn't look far enough. the manual way to inspect the history of object tags is at the bottom of the link for the object, like    Download XML Â· View History that gives a URL like https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/18855621/history with details for each revision over time. it could be easier to pass the way (or node or relation) ID to https://osmlab.github.io/osm-deep-history/ where the changed attributes are highlighted in the listing for each changeset. hope that's what you wanted to know. but what about the case where an originally concrete road has decayed to the point where patching is pointless yet it still forms a solid base for being overpaved with asphalt to save money, and the original mapper used paved to refer to the concrete?  you're both right...  i'll go away."," freebeer, you're just a troublemaker.

Under the context of my intentions with this resource, would a canned comment of ""XXX Golf course mapping"" be adequate or do you believe it would be necessary to provide an overview of the exact changes (such as ""mapped XXX golf course hole 1?"").  I absolutely love the availability of this resource and the developers who created the software to accommodate the creation of courses in the simulator...  Point me in the right direction to be in compliance and I assure you all future descriptions will be noted as such."," Hi Jaymac, thanks for mapping - we've noticed a lot of additions to golf courses recently due to the use of the data in the simulator, it is a clever use of the data and everyone benefits from the more accurate maps. For changeset comments, they are mostly used in the moment by people who are reviewing local changes to make sure they are correct, and in the future by mappers wanting to understand why the previous editor had changed something (perhaps years in the past). They don't need to be in depth, but something like, ""Adding details to Lake Ridge golf course from aerial imagery"" would usually be sufficient. If what you are changing isn't obvious, say, Bing has the old course and Maxar Imagery has the new course, an explanation helps people know what you did, ""Adding details to golf course from Maxar, most updated imagery in this location"".", Got it!  Thanks for the help!," Thanks a lot both. I'm mostly remote mapping (outside my city in Germany) and either research addresses not found (house to street connections, broken city relations) or tag values not following a format, e.g. 6 digit US zip codes. Adding a comment which type of object you edited already helps. All the best from Germany."

" Hi again U2429POP, This is the second comment I am posting about the footways you are adding.  Many of the footways you are adding obviously do not exist due to their impossible angles or the fact that they pass through obstacles such as buildings or fences.  Some of the other footways you are adding are already on the map and don't need to be duplicated. You are also frequently using footways incorrectly. One such example is that you are using them to show the divisions of parking bays in parking lots, this is not the correct usage for this tag. Please only add real features to OSM.

" I'm not sure it makes sense to tag the stations themselves as ""level=-2"".  I would consider the entire facility (the concourse level, platform level, elevators, etc. to be the station.  It would make sense for the individual elements inside the station to get a level tag though."," I see what you're saying. I would consider the platform level to be the relevant level to assign to the station, the rest being just indoor pedestrian circulation. Either way, I guess it's unclear whether the level tag belongs on the station node in the first place. I want to think through to alternate ways of mapping stations. Station polygons fulfill the same role as station nodes, and they're drawn as a convex hull around the stops and platforms (and switches if present). If I were to trace the station polygons here, should I assign them a level tag? If so, what?  The most straightforward answer to me would be to have one polygon for each station, and to assign it the same level as the railway infrastructure it surrounds. I'd like to hear your thoughts."

 So we are deleting spam? I was removing the description tag but otherwise leaving them alone.," I'm trying to take a measured approach here. If something is properly tagged(*) but has a spammy description, I will *normally* delete the spammy description only, except if the object in question is clearly added by a SEO spammer in violation of our mechanical/organised edit rules (e.g. hundreds of dubious ""Bitcoin of America"" ATMs) and/or clearly part of a scammy industry for which SEO spam is part of their business (Locksmiths being a prime example). (*) I would normally count something as ""properly tagged"" if it has a halfway correct leisure/amenity/shop/offfice etc. tag; some businesses egregiously tag themselves amenity=place_of_worship and I will delete them without exception, some don't tag themselves at all (only name, description, opening hours) in which case I'll mostly delete them, and some use the wildcard office=company in which case it's a judgement call.

" Howdy RC... someone just added a minimally-tagged nightclub named ""Berlin"" in this same location ( https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/7199447385 ) and my gut tells me it's the same place, but since I haven't been there myself I figured I'd ask -- I don't suppose ""Berlin Under A"" is actually under ""Berlin"" or something silly like that?"," Hiya jmapb! I assume this is supposed to be the same. The name of the venue is actually ""Berlin Under A,"" however, as their website can attest (https://berlinundera.com). I will, however, add a tag for live music, since this place does have that, but I'm not sure I would describe this as a nightclub ie. a discoâ€”it's more like a bar-music venue that maybe sometimes acts like a disco."," Gotcha -- Some people are starting to use the amenity=music_venue tag. Unlike a bar, a music venue supposedly won't be open for business unless there's a show, like a theater. But amenity=music_venue isn't rendered yet so I tend to use bar/theatre/nightclub, and sometimes it's a close call which of these is best. Anyway, I see you've already taken care of the Berlin clone, thanks!"

" I have reverted the revert and fixed the tags. The information was a bit spammy, sure, but I think it would have been better to leave it to be verified on the ground."," it would be one thing were this to be a simple beginner edit, where georg provided the appropriate feedback to an obvious genuine newbie as seen within a day or so mixed with dozens of seo dump cleanups, but this edit bears all the fingerprints of a paid professional who has no interest in mapping properly or learning osm and iD despite multiple edjts, and is more than happy to dump malformed data and rely on unpaid volunteers to correct them as you have, or to clean them up as georg does probably hundreds of times per day, and as i do elsewhere dozens of times daily. if you are happy to do that work, then go ahead, as locally it may not seem a burden, but multiply the hundreds of buggy additions per day by the same repeated bad actors and i'll posit that real mappers have better things to do than fixing bad edits, and there is already too much bad data needing a clean-up that is being ignored, be it in the form of unacted notes or bad data like this. iD should not permit a beginner to make these sorts of tagging mistakes, and if this so-called beginner is skipping the tutorial to dump a template of the wrong format into osm, well, i tell you, ...  there's enough wrong and poor data that waiting for on-the-ground verification will lower the osm quality to the point nobody will bother, as can be seen in many poorly-mapped areas."," Good points, and things I did not consider. I guess it's hard to tell if it's the owner of the business (as the username could suggest either way), or an SEO company. I understand that at large scales, this would get very annoying..."," The point is that I am giving contributors the opportunity to report this misconception. (...

" Hi Brian@Brea, nice toy with 'GoMap' to capture the data - but the https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/771150180 doesn't look like natural=wood to me - more like landuse=grass. Have you ever had a quiet look at the powerful JavaOpenStreetmap-Editor (JOSM) https://josm.openstreetmap.de/ ? Or have a look at the many subpages of wiki.openstreetmap.org/ in the evening ? Regards vogelfreier/Rüdiger Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", The original purpose to this edit is to update the area with new data not yet visible yet on Ariel imagery as I live in the area and visit this parking lot every couple of weeks. New Parking toll booths have been installed on the North-East portion of the lot. I was dividing the original tagged “wooded” area where the likely driveway entrance will be. I did not realize at the time that the way is currently tagged as natural=wood as I probably tagged the definition several years ago when I was new to the OSM project. A better tag will be landuse=forest but I am going to hold any updates to foliage until have done a proper inspection to this corner of the lot.  Speaking of using a more powerful editor...I currently have been using Potlatch for a majority of my edits but I have found with Go Map to be able to get more accurate node placement as well it easier to correct overlapping way issues with the app. Potlatch is great with big picture edits and Relationship tags but if you want to make a smooth curve kerb you need to have better control over node placement. ," Speaking of using JOSM, I last tried JOSM several years and did not like the user interface compared to Potlatch. But with both Google and Microsoft abandoning Flash player support in the coming months I might need to start using it with Potlatch relying on Flash."," actually, you ought to be able to continue to use potlatch so long as osm keeps links to the p1 and p2 executables.  just keep one or more flash binaries downloaded and saved, and keep an old version of a compatible browser that you don't update, maybe in a restricted sandbox if security concerns you. i've a several-year-old browser/flash combination on what was my work server, used for almost exclusively osm work, but that hardware died some months ago, and while my attempts to swap the drive into a similarly-lightning-damaged box were partly successful, apart from the damaged and missing hardware i took for granted, and i was able to do quick cleanups with potlatch1, it seems the change of graphics results in potlatch2 bombing early on, so if it's worth the bother, i'd suggest getting a known-working setup and then freezing the critical potlatch parts of it.  my own substitute had so much difficulty starting iD that i gave up on visual editing.  i may revisit why i can't fire up potlatch/flash on the android handy i use for now, or spend my time properly rebuilding the borrowed machine with hdmi-video and functioning ethernets (got maybe a dozen that caught fire in various devices), or work on something else entirely."

We 'care' IMO because navaids of the same type (a VORTAC, for instance) that cover different service volumes actually look different, not necessarily the building itself but the obstruction-free zone that is the rest of the site.", Unfortunately the FAA doesn't tell us which ones are DVORs.," Ok, did you discuss this with other mappers of such features?

" I'm not seeing any real reason these should have been upgraded, lettered state highways in Missouri are Missouri's state tertiary highways behind the numbered state highways (secondary) and US highways (primary).             ---              Published using OSMCha: https://osmcha.mapbox.com/changesets/62073034  "," Hi Paul, I questioned the same thing in my head before making these changes, but decided to follow the OSM standard for these roads vs, the state of Missouri standard. (https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway=secondary)  I was thinking this way all roads regardless of there jurisdiction would would be classified the same based on their construction and usage.   I even compared some other states and looked at the roads via Google streets to aid in my decisions. I am open for more discussion and comments on this, in the end I'm just trying to make the map more accurate, and consistent. Chris             ---              Published using OSMCha: https://osmcha.mapbox.com/changesets/62073034  "," Well, I would avoid using Google Streetview as it's not license compatible with our editing. If it's a particularly large road, I might consider bumping up to secondary or primary, but for a lot of these rural roads, tertiary is ample. There is a tendency to have priority creep on the highway tag, particularly in Texas where they have like, 7 state secondary networks that should qualify as tertiary, and three people trying to keep an eye on literally thousands of such routes in Texas. Resisting the creep definitely helps, particularly if other aspects that may influence routing (like minspeed, maxspeed, etc) are accurately represented (often reasons people might game the tag a bit)"," Got here via https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/61339116 and no reason to split the same conversation up. On the highway=secondary page, the most important piece of information is ""A highway linking large towns."", and then bear in mind that for the US, a *small* place=town is 10,000 people. So a 10 mile stretch of paved road with a divider that links a few dozen houses to the main state highway network does not meet that definition. In general, US highway tagging suffers from the idea that the construction should guide tagging, as we have lots of relatively well built roads. It's useful to also consider the role of the road in the highway system when deciding which tag to use."

" Dear OSMWeekly, what is this task about?"," Hi Belobog. 146 is adding buildings to the metro area around Tulsa, OK as well as cleaning up exisitng building footprints. I admit though, often go overboard and add parking, parking aisles, and other easy to spot things as well as clear up deprecated tags when JOSM notifies me. ", Here's the page: https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/project/146#bottom
 What the heck is this supposed to be?, Why does this change span 90% of the continental United States?, A couple changes in Washington state and a couple of changes in mid-Florida will do that. This is why you save your work before moving to another area.
" FYI - Gluing ""natural="" areas to civic boundaries really shouldn't be done. Gluing land areas to water bodies in generally frowned on, too. Just so you know."," What is the best practice, then, for a ""natural"" space that immediately abuts a civic boundary? This is particularly relevant in Oregon, where nonfarm development is generally prohibited beyond civic boundaries."," There may be rare times when gluing them together makes sense, but it is usually easier to maintain if they remain separate shapes. One way to do this is to use the filters in iD (or JOSM) to hide the other features - for instance, when setting up the natural area you can hide Boundaries, and when working on the boundary you can hide Landuse features. Using the filters to hide everything except what you are working on is a good way to prevent inadvertent gluing."," Yeah - what phideaux said. I was going to give another example of what you could do - but now notice that you're using Potlatch... which I know absolutely nothing about. Well if you *were* using iD, you can create your natural area and snap to whatever boundaries you desire, and then when done, while the new area is selected and fully visible (zoom out if necessary), hit ""d"" to disconnect all nodes. In essence, it's far less future work for mappers should landuse or boundaries change - then only the one element needs to be updated. Ultimately not a *huge* deal - mostly just a helpful fyi from a fellow pnw-er."

I'm assuming you're local to Milwaukee, so I'll defer to your judgment on whether the longer name is necessary for disambiguation.
